            <h2>THE KID LAROI </h2>
            <p>[Intro] Okay, I realize now, that everything that I did was wrong <br>
                Okay, I realize now, some things are better off said than done <br>
                Okay, I realize now, that maybe I'm not ready for lovevv<br>
                Okay, I realize now, I finished us before we begun-un-un<br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play<br>
                I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring<br>
                I'm tryna figure this all out for myself<br>
                I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done<br>
                So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done<br>
                (Oh no, no-no-no, no-no-no)<br>
                [Verse]<br>
                I think that it's time for you to realize<br>
                That I'm not gon' be here forever but I<br>
                Wish that I was, but you were the cause<br>
                For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside<br>
                Sometimes I sit and I think about why<br>
                I even trusted you, shit, I'm surprised<br>
                I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time<br>
                Want you to walk out and walk out of my life<br>
                And you, yeah, you (Yeah, you)
                You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to<br>
                And you, yeah, you<br>
                The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna fight no more<br>

            <h1>POST MALONE</h1>
            <h2>cicles </h2>
            <p>We couldn’t turn around<br>
                Til we were upside down<br>
                I’ll be the bad guy now<br>
                But know I ain’t too proud<br>
                I couldn’t be there<br>
                Even when I tried<br>
                You don’t believe it<br>
                We do this every time
                Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
                Feed the flame because we can’t let go<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway<br>
                I dare you to do something<br>
                I’m waiting on you again<br>
                So I don’t take the blame<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway, runaway<br>
                Let gobr<br>
                I got a feeling that it’s time to let go<br>
                I said so<br>
                I knew that this was doomed from the get go<br>
                You thought that it was special, special<br>
                But it was just the sex though, the sex though<br>
                And I still hear the echoes, the echoes<br>
                I got a feeling that it’s time to let it go<br>
                Let it go<br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
                Feed the flame because we can’t let go<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway<br>
                I dare you to do something<br>
                I’m waiting on you again<br>
                So I don’t take the blame<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway, runaway<br>
                Maybe you don’t understand what I’m going thru<br>
                It’s only me, what you got to lose<br>
                Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do<br>
                It’s only me, let it go<br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
                Feed the flame because we can’t let go<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway<br>
                I dare you to do something<br>
                I’m waiting on you again<br>
                So I don’t take the blame<br>
                Runaway but we’re running in circles<br>
                Runaway, runaway, runaway<br>
